A revised version of "Gibbs Posterior Concentration Rates under Sub-exponential Type Losses" is available on the [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.04505).  It's now accepted at [Bernoulli](http://www.bernoulli-society.org/publications/bernoulli-journal/bernoulli-journal-papers).

A new paper on Inferential Models and prediction---with applications to randomized, on-farm agricultural trials---is now available on the [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.01848).  I'm presenting this work at the [Conference on Applied Statistics in Agriculture](https://caas.usu.edu/agstats2022/contact-us) at Utah State this May.
